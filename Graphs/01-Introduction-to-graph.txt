GRAPH : Basic requirement for a graph that it consisit of a node (vertex) and a edge. So we can say that every tree is a graph but all graph
is not a tree.

Basically we have two types of Graphs
1> Undirected Graphs
2> Directed Graphs

Undirected Graphs : Graphs in which there is no direction in edges is known as Undirected Graphs.

eg.
    A -- B
    |    |
    |    |
    |    |
    C -- D
    \  /
     \/
     E

Directed Graphs : Graph in which there is defined direction in edges is known as Directed Graphs.
eg. 
    A --> B
    |     |
    |     |
    |     |
    v     v
    C <-- D
    \     / 
     \   / 
      v  v
        E

Cyclic Graph : when you start from a node and come back we call it cyclic graph.
    Directed Cyclic Graph (DAG) & Undirected Cyclic Graph.

Path : Contains a lot of nodes and each of them reachable (only unique)

eg for graph A --- B        Path: A -> B -> C -> D
                   |              A -> B -> C -> B -> A (Not a path u can not take a node again) 
                   |              A -> C (Not a reachable node)
             D --- C
                 /
                /
               E

Degree of Node in Undirected Graph : no of edges attached to a node.
Total Degree of a Graph = 2 * E (E = no of edges)

for Directed Graph
    InDegree of a node : no of incoming edges to a node.
    OutDegree of a node : no of outgoing edges to a node.

Edge Weight : Assigned weight to a edge is called as edge weight if not assigned assume unit weight 1
